# Sales Dashboard Project 📈📊

Welcome to the repository for our Sales Dashboard project!

This project aims to build a desktop application using Python and PyQt6 to track sales data from an Excel file. We will create a user-friendly graphical interface to visualize key sales metrics and make data analysis easier. The project will be developed collaboratively and version-controlled using Git on this repository.

## Project Goals 🎯

* Develop a functional sales dashboard application.
* Learn and utilize Python, PyQt6, pandas, and openpyxl.
* Integrate with Microsoft Excel files for data input.
* Create a clean and intuitive graphical user interface (GUI).
* Manage the project effectively using Git and GitHub.
* Package the application into a standalone executable for sharing.

## Our Action Plan 🗺️

We will follow these steps to build the dashboard:

1.  **Understand Specific Needs 🤔:**
    * Clarify the structure of your sales Excel file (columns like Date, Product, Quantity, Unit Price, Customer, etc.).
    * Determine the key sales insights and visualizations you want on the dashboard (Total Sales, Sales by Product, Sales over Time, Top Performers, etc.).
    * Identify any specific features needed (date filtering, product filtering, specific charts).

2.  **Project Setup & Environment 🛠️:**
    * Create a project folder.
    * Set up a Python virtual environment to manage dependencies.
    * Install necessary libraries: `PyQt6`, `pandas`, `openpyxl`.
    * Initialize a local Git repository and link it to this GitHub repository (`https://github.com/JohnMoriarty009`).
    * Make our first commit! 🎉

3.  **Data Loading & Processing (Python/pandas) 📄➡️🧠:**
    * Write Python code to read data from your Excel file using `pandas`.
    * Explain how to clean and transform data if needed (handling dates, missing values).
    * Structure the data for easy use in the GUI.

4.  **GUI Design (PyQt6) 🎨🖱️:**
    * Introduce PyQt6 basics: main windows, layouts, and essential widgets (tables, labels, buttons).
    * Design the layout of the main dashboard window.
    * Add widgets to display sales data and key metrics.
    * Include controls for user interaction (e.g., a button to load data, filter options).

5.  **Connecting Data to GUI 🤝📲:**
    * Implement the logic to display the processed data from pandas within the PyQt6 widgets.
    * Explain how to update the GUI dynamically when data changes (e.g., after applying filters).

6.  **Developing Dashboard Features ✨:**
    * Calculate and display key sales indicators.
    * Implement filtering and sorting functionalities based on your needs.
    * *(Optional, based on requirements)* Integrate charts/graphs using libraries like Matplotlib or Plotly within the PyQt6 interface.

7.  **Versioning with GitHub 💾☁️:**
    * Regularly commit changes with clear, descriptive messages (`git commit`).
    * Push code updates to this repository (`git push`) at significant milestones.
    * Discuss using branches for developing new features or bug fixes.

8.  **Application Packaging 📦🚀:**
    * Use a tool like `PyInstaller` to convert the Python script into a standalone executable application.
    * Explain the packaging process.

9.  **Testing & Debugging 🐛🩹:**
    * Test the application thoroughly to identify any issues.
    * Fix bugs and make commits for each correction.

Let's get started on building this awesome sales dashboard! 💪
